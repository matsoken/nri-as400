# New Relic integration for AS/400

iSeries / AS400 monitoring solution for New Relic Infrastructure. Actually split into 4 separate OHIs, all described below.

## Prerequisites

- New Relic Infrastructure Agent installed on a Linux host
- Linux host must be able to remotely address the iSeries/AS400 server(s) in question

## Installation

- Unzip/gunzip nri-as400 package on host where NRI Agent is installed
- Test your credentials and parameters with [`nri-as400-test.sh`](#testing-with-nri-as400-testsh)
- Edit `nri-as400/nri-as400-config.yml`, configuring instances of the 4 OHIs outlined below as needed.
  - [as400-job-list - iSeries Active Jobs](#config-as400-job-list)
  - [as400-memory-status - iSeries Server Memory Usage KPIs](#config-as400-memory-status)
  - [as400-message-queue - iSeries Message Queues](#config-as400-message-queue)
  - [as400-system-status - iSeries Server KPIs](#config-as400-system-status)
- run `nri-as400/install_linux.sh`

### Testing with `nri-as400-test.sh` <a id="testing-with-nri-as400-testsh"></a>
This collection of OHIs comes with `nri-as400-test.sh`, a shell script to verify:
* connectivity to AS400 host
* credentials and other parameters
* data returned by the OHI instances

To use nri-as400-test.sh:
1. Edit `nri-as400-test.sh`, setting the environment variables at the top to the settings you will use in this configuration.
2. If not executable, run `chmod +x nri-as400-test.sh`
3. Run `./nri-as400-test.sh [job-list|memory-status|message-queue|system-status]`

## Configuration

Each section below details the possible settings for an instance of that OHI. All of these settings should be in the `instances:` stanza of `nri-as400-config.yml`.

### as400-job-list - iSeries Active Jobs <a id="config-as400-job-list"></a>
```yaml
instances:
  - name: pub400_jobs
    command: job-list
    arguments:
      as400host: pub400.com
      userid: USER0465
      passwd: user0465
      reset_wait_delay: 100
```

* `name`: The name of the instance, usually the host and "_jobs"
* `as400host`: The iSeries host.
* `userid`: The user that has access to the message queue.
* `passwd`: The password for the user.
* `reset_wait_delay`: The delay interval (in ms) between resetting stats and capturing them - optional, default to 100ms
* `retrieve_msgw`: Retrieves the outstanding last message for jobs with an active job status of MSGW. Optional, default to false

#### Notes
* This OHI can be configured to pull job data from multiple iSeries servers
* **Recommended**: Depending on the server, this could take over 60 seconds to complete. [Test using `nri-as400-test.sh job-list`](#testing-with-nri-as400-testsh) and note the time it takes to complete. If longer than 60 seconds, increase the `interval` in `nri-as400-definition.yml` to be at least as long as that time.
* The attributes collected for each job are a subset of those that can be included, and it would not be difficult to extend the agent to collect additional attributes.

### as400-memory-status - iSeries Server Memory Usage KPIs <a id="config-as400-memory-status"></a>

```yaml
instances:
  - name: pub400_status
    command: memory-status
    arguments:
      as400host: pub400.com
      userid: USER0465
      passwd: user0465
```

* `name`: The name of the instance, usually the host and "_status"
* `as400host`: The iSeries host.
* `userid`: The user that has access to the message queue.
* `passwd`: The password for the user.

#### Notes
* This OHI can be configured to pull server memory usage KPIs from multiple iSeries servers.
* Execution interval should be fine at 30 to 60 seconds.

### as400-message-queue - iSeries Message Queues <a id="config-as400-message-queue"></a>

```yaml
instances:
  - name: pub400_queue_QSYSOPR
    command: message-queue
    arguments:
      instance: pub400.QSYSOPR
      as400host: pub400.com
      msgqueue: /QSYS.LIB/QSYSOPR.MSGQ
      userid: USER0465
      passwd: user0465
```

* `name`: The name of the instance, an instance being a combination of iSeries host and message queue.
* `as400host`: The iSeries host.
* `userid`: The user that has access to the message queue.
* `passwd`: The password for the user.
* `instance`: Can be the same as `name`, used to build / maintain the checkpoint file.
* `msgqueue`: The iSeries message queue to be monitored.

#### Notes

* This OHI can be configured to monitor multiple Messages Queues on Multiple iSeries servers.
* The agent on startup will read and post the last message in the queue, subsequent executions will read from the last read message and process only new messages.
* There are checkpoint files which contain the binary value of the 4 byte message key that was last processed in the OHI working directory (usually /var/db/newrelic-infra/custom-integrations). Deleting the checkpoint file will force the agent to only read the latest message, this might be helpful / required in the message queue does not reset after an IPL (like QSYSOPR).
* Execution interval should take into account the verbosity of the queue, however in general 30 to 60 seconds should be fine.

### as400-system-status - iSeries Server KPIs <a id="config-as400-system-status"></a>

```yaml
instances:
  - name: pub400_status
    command: system-status
    arguments:
      as400host: pub400.com
      userid: USER0465
      passwd: user0465
```

* `name`: The name of the instance, usually the host and "_status"
* `as400host`: The iSeries host.
* `userid`: The user that has access to the message queue.
* `passwd`: The password for the user.

#### Notes
* This OHI can be configured to pull server KPIs from multiple iSeries servers.
* Execution interval should be fine at 30 to 60 seconds.
